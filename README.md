# OPOST AUTOMATION

Automate opost reporting of pending follow up , web scrapping project 

## OverView

In opost system the pending shipments must be actively monitored and solved within a short timeframe 

A team of employees frequently monitors pending shipments in the system to ensure fast delivery.
At the end of the day, the pending manager must submit a report on each employee.

### The Problem :

Employee QOS reports are manually generated by reviewing all shipments resolved per employee and storing the data in an Excel file. The back-office manager must then take a random sample and verify response times by manually entering each shipment number into the system.


The reporting process is extremely time-consuming, leading to a backlog of work and significantly hindering overall efficiency.

*__and here comes the solution !__*

### Solution :


A browser automation program using Selenium WebDriver is introduced to streamline the process, reducing manual effort and significantly improving efficiency.

The process that previously took an entire workday is now completed in an hour or less, even for a large number of shipments.
